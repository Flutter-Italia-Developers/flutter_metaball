## flutter_metaballs

Metaballs are organic-looking n-dimensional isosurfaces, characterised 
by their ability to meld together when in close proximity to create single, 
contiguous objects. (Ref. [WikipediA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs))

Look at the parameters in the main.dart example and change them to try out different configurations.
Later we will find out what this package can be useful for! 😄️
